# What changed

The newest version first. MedSearch shows the entry for a new version in the
update prompt, so this file is what a user reads before choosing to update:
one line per change, in plain words, no internals.

## 1.8

- The menu bar icon puts itself back when it disappears, and MedSearch writes down when it went (`~/.medsearch/menubar.log`) so the reason can be found.

## 1.7

- Changing a setting no longer asks for your Mac password once for every key you have saved: only a key you actually changed is written to the Keychain.

## 1.6

- The update prompt now says what the new version changes.
- Sci-Hub mirrors reorder themselves when one stops working.

## 1.5

- API keys are kept in the macOS Keychain instead of a settings file.
- Settings shows what the AI has cost this month, and can stop it at a monthly limit you set.

## 1.4

- The menu bar item is part of MedSearch now: one app to install and update, instead of two.
- Closing the window leaves MedSearch in the menu bar; Settings can start it at login.
- A new icon, and the whole interface brought into one style.
- AI answers are shown as proper headings and lists instead of raw Markdown.
- Errors always arrive as a dialog, never a note that scrolls past.
